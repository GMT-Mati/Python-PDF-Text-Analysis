# Python PDF Text Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python project for analyzing text data extracted from PDF documents. The project includes tools and scripts for extracting text from PDF files, performing various text analysis tasks, and generating insights from the extracted text data.

## Features

- PDF Text Extraction: Extract text content from PDF documents.
- Text Preprocessing: Preprocess the extracted text data, including text cleaning and normalization.
- Text Analysis: Perform various text analysis tasks, such as word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.
- Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., word clouds, sentiment plots) to visualize the results of text analysis.
- Insights: Generate insights and conclusions from the text data analysis.
